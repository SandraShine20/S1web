    <h1>OVERVIEW OF HTTP</h1>
    <p>
        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative,
        hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e.
        internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well
        using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

        Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files,
        query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It
        provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how
        clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.

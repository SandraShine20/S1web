    <h1>Web Security</h1>
    <p>
        Web security is a broad category of security solutions that protect your users, devices, and wider network
        against internet-based cyberattacks—malware, phishing, and more—that can lead to breaches and data loss. It
        reduces the security risk to your organization when your users accidentally access malicious files and websites
        through some combination of firewall inspection, intrusion prevention system (IPS) scanning, sandboxing, URL
        filtering, and various other security and access controls.

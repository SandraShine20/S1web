    <h1>Client-Server</h1>
    <p>The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the
        providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server
        architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server
        accepts the requested process and delivers the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share
        any of their resources. Examples of the Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.

        <h1>Introduction to web</h1>
        <p>Web Technology refers to the various tools and techniques that are utilized in the process of communication
            between different types of devices over the Internet. A web browser is used to access web pages. Web browsers
            can be defined as programs that display text, data, pictures, animation, and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked
            resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web browsers.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="client"><h1>Client-Server</h1>
        <p>The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the
            providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server
            architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server
            accepts the requested process and delivers the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share
            any of their resources. Examples of the Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.

    <div id="application">
        <h1>Application Server</h1>
    <p>An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the
        operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system [DBMS],
        communications and Internet services) on another side and the users' applications on the third side.

            Web security is a broad category of security solutions that protect your users, devices, and wider network
            against internet-based cyberattacks—malware, phishing, and more—that can lead to breaches and data loss. It
            reduces the security risk to your organization when your users accidentally access malicious files and websites
            through some combination of firewall inspection, intrusion prevention system (IPS) scanning, sandboxing, URL
            filtering, and various other security and access controls.

        <h1>OVERVIEW OF HTTP</h1>
    <p>
        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative,
        hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e.
        internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well
        using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

        Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files,
        query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It
        provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how
        clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.
